            This wholistic approach to medicine helped him evaluate and treat the patient as an individual and as a
            whole, not just honing in on one organ system. The concepts of wellness are complex, and this training has
            given him the basis to providing his TrueMD methods, which he teaches to Affiliates of TrueMD. Next, his
            internship a Charity Hospital, New Orleans, through Tulane University helped him to have first-hand
            experience in many surgical disciplines, but primarily in OB- GYN This started him on his quest to consider
            and determine all thebest pathways to help women, and men, fight off a multitude of medical conditions that

            them, which helped him gain the knowledge, experience, and caring spirit to help him formulate his TrueMD
            program with the patient's concerns in mind. Returning to Charity Hospital, he finished his residency
            through Tulane University and set up his practice in OB-GYN in Arlington, TX. During his 26 years of
            experiences delivering babies and treating women for gynecologic needs, his foremost passion was to help
            women improve their health. To this end, he prescribed hormone therapy and weight-loss therapies because he
            is and has always been an advocate for women and women's care. Youdon't have to suffer from the multitude of
